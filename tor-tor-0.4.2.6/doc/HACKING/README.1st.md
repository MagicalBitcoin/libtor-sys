In this directory
-----------------

This directory has helpful information about what you need to know to
hack on Tor!

First, read `GettingStarted.md` to learn how to get a start in Tor
development.

If you've decided to write a patch, `CodingStandards.txt` will give
you a bunch of information about how we structure our code.

It's important to get code right!  Reading `WritingTests.md` will
tell you how to write and run tests in the Tor codebase.

There are a bunch of other programs we use to help maintain and
develop the codebase: `HelpfulTools.md` can tell you how to use them
with Tor.

If it's your job to put out Tor releases, see `ReleasingTor.md` so
that you don't miss any steps!


-----------------------

For full information on how Tor is supposed to work, look at the files in
`https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree`.

For an explanation of how to change Tor's design to work differently, look at
`https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/001-process.txt`.

For the latest version of the code, get a copy of git, and

    git clone https://git.torproject.org/git/tor

We talk about Tor on the `tor-talk` mailing list.  Design proposals and
discussion belong on the `tor-dev` mailing list.  We hang around on
irc.oftc.net, with general discussion happening on #tor and development
happening on `#tor-dev`.

The other files in this `HACKING` directory may also be useful as you
get started working with Tor.

Happy hacking!
