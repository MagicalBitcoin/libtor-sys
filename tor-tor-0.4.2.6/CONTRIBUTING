Contributing to Tor
-------------------

### Getting started

Welcome!

We have a bunch of documentation about how to develop Tor in the
doc/HACKING/ directory.  We recommend that you start with
doc/HACKING/README.1st.md , and then go from there.  It will tell
you how to find your way around the source code, how to get
involved with the Tor community, how to write patches, and much
more!

You don't have to be a C developer to help with Tor: have a look
at https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer !

The Tor Project is committed to fostering a inclusive community
where people feel safe to engage, share their points of view, and
participate. For the latest version of our Code of Conduct, please
