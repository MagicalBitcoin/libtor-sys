  o Major bugfixes (vanguards):
    - We had omitted some checks for whether our vanguards (second layer
      guards from proposal 333) overlapped. Now make sure to pick each
      of them to be independent. Also, change the design to allow them to
      come from the same family. Fixes bug 40639; bugfix on 0.4.7.1-alpha.
