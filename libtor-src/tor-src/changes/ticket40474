  o Minor bugfixes (onion service, TROVE-2021-008):
    - Only log once any v2 access attempts in order to not pollute the logs
      with warnings and avoid recording the times on disk when v2 access was
      attempted. Important to note that the onion address was _never_ logged.
      That is a Low security issue. Fixes bug 40474; bugfix on 0.4.5.8.
