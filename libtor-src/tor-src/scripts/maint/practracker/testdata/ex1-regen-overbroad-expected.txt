# Welcome to the exceptions file for Tor's best-practices tracker!
#
# Each line of this file represents a single violation of Tor's best
# practices -- typically, a violation that we had before practracker.py
# first existed.
#
# There are three kinds of problems that we recognize right now:
#   function-size -- a function of more than 100 lines.
#   file-size -- a .c file of more than 3000 lines, or a .h
#      file with more than 500 lines.
#   include-count -- a .c file with more than 50 #includes,
#      or a .h file with more than 15 #includes.
#   dependency-violation -- a file includes a header that it should
#      not, according to an advisory .may_include file.
#
# Each line below represents a single exception that practracker should
# _ignore_. Each line has four parts:
#  1. The word "problem".
#  2. The kind of problem.
#  3. The location of the problem: either a filename, or a
#     filename:functionname pair.
#  4. The magnitude of the problem to ignore.
#
# So for example, consider this line:
#    problem file-size /src/core/or/connection_or.c 3200
#
# It tells practracker to allow the mentioned file to be up to 3200 lines
# long, even though ordinarily it would warn about any file with more than
# 3000 lines.
#
# You can either edit this file by hand, or regenerate it completely by
# running `make practracker-regen`.
#
# Remember: It is better to fix the problem than to add a new exception!
