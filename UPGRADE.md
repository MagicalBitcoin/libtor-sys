**Probably makes sense to run those on an older linux distro, so that the configure is generated by an older version of `aclocal`**

```
# tar xf tor-0.4.blah blah

patch -d tor-tor-* -p0 < patches/*

cd tor-tor-*
sh autogen.sh
cd ../
```

reconfigure libevent with an older aclocal

```
cd libevent-sys/libevent-*
sh autogen.sh
cd ../../
```
