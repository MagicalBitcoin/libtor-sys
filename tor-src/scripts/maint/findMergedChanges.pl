Usage:
   findMergedChanges.pl [--merged/--unmerged/--weird/--list] [--branch=<branchname] [--head=<branchname>] changes/*

A change is "merged" if it has ever been merged to release-0.2.4 and it has had
no subsequent changes in master.

A change is "unmerged" if it has never been merged to release-0.2.4 and it
has had changes in master.

A change is "weird" if it has been merged to release-0.2.4 and it *has* had
subsequent changes in master.

Suggested application:
   findMergedChanges.pl --merged changes/* | xargs -n 1 git rm
