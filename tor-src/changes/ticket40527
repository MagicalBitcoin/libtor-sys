  o Major bugfixes (relay, overload):
    - Don't make Tor DNS timeout trigger an overload general state. These
      timeouts are different from DNS server timeout. They have to be seen as
      timeout related to UX and not because of a network problem. Fixes bug
      40527; bugfix on 0.4.6.1-alpha.
