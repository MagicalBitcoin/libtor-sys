  o Minor bugfixes (compiler compatibility):
    - Avoid compiler warnings from Clang 10 related to the use of
      GCC-style "/* falls through */" comments.  Both Clang and GCC allow
      __attribute__((fallthrough)) instead, so that's what we're using now.
      Fixes bug 34078; bugfix on 0.3.1.3-alpha.
