  o Minor features (compatibility, Linux seccomp sandbox):
    - Add a workaround to enable the Linux sandbox to work correctly
      on systems running Glibc 2.33.  These versions have started
      using the fstatat() system call, which previously our sandbox did not
      allow.
      Closes ticket 40382; see the ticket for a discussion of tradeoffs.
