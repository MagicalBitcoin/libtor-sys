  o Minor bugfix (onion service):
    - Do not flag an HSDir as non-running in case the descriptor upload or
      fetch fails. An onion service closes pending directory connections
      before uploading a new descriptor which can thus lead to wrongly
      flagging many relays and thus affecting circuit building path selection.
      Fixes bug 40434; bugfix on 0.2.0.13-alpha.
