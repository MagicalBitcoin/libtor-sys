  o Minor bugfixes (timekeeping):
    - Calculate the time of day correctly on systems where the time_t
      type includes leap seconds. (This is not the case on most
      operating systems, but on those where it occurs, our tor_timegm
      function did not correctly invert the system's gmtime function,
      which could result in assertion failures when calculating
      voting schedules.)  Fixes bug 40383; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.
