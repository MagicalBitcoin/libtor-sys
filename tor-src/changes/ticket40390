  o Major bugfixes (security, defense-in-depth):
    - Detect a wider variety of failure conditions from the OpenSSL RNG
      code. Previously, we would detect errors from a missing RNG
      implementation, but not failures from the RNG code itself.
      Fortunately, it appears those failures do not happen in practice
      when Tor is using OpenSSL's default RNG implementation.
      Fixes bug 40390; bugfix on 0.2.8.1-alpha. This issue is also tracked as
      TROVE-2021-004. Reported by Jann Horn at Google's Project Zero.
