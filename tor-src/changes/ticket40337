  o Minor features (testing):
    - On a testing network, relays can now use the
      TestingMinTimeToReportBandwidth option to change
      the smallest amount of time over which they're willing to report
      their observed maximum bandwidth.  Previously, this was fixed
      at 1 day.  For safety, values under 2 hours are only supported on
      testing networks. Part of a fix for ticket 40337.

  o Minor features (testing):
    - Relays on testing networks now report their observed bandwidths
      immediately from startup.  Previously, they waited
      until they had been running for a full day.   Closes ticket
      40337.
    - Relays on testing networks no longer rate-limit how frequently
      they are willing to report new bandwidth measurements. Part of a fix
      for ticket 40337.
